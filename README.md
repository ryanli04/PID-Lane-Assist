# üõ£Ô∏è PID Lane Assist Project

## Overview
This project implements a **PID-controlled lane assist system** for a simulated autonomous vehicle using **MATLAB and Simulink**. The system detects lane positions and continuously adjusts steering to keep the vehicle centered, demonstrating **real-time control, sensor feedback, and control system design**.

Designed as a **student-friendly project**, it helps visualize PID control, tuning, and autonomous vehicle dynamics.
